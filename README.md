# jenga

In this project, we are trying to implement a intuitive 3D User interface (3DUI) to recreate a VR version of Jenga game, in which the user interacts with the one object at any given time. The 3DUI for our game requires precise manipulation like selecting, translating, rotating, and dropping in order to keep the Jenga tower stable. Our keen interest in exploring and learning about implementing 3DUI, all along while creating a playable game, fuels our motivation for this project. 

# How to play

The mouse is primarily used to move the blocks. To rotate the selected block users can press the up and down buttons on the keyboard. To rotate the camera around the tower the user can press either the right or left arrow keys. Once a block has fallen and hit the floor the game is over and a "You Lose" text will appear in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.

# Future Work

This is ongoing project. The next steps are to implement the hands modules into unity to be able to play the game with the leap motion.
